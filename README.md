This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

This is a summer project of mine that I am making to learn how to integrate NextJS with Google Firebase. This is a WIP "bucket list," where my friends can login and add their ideas to a board that shows what events will be happening.

The plan for this project is to eventually get it to the point where users can be added by an admin to a group, where if they are a member in that group, they can post and interact with the board. Right now, my aim is to make a "global board" and worry about groups and roles later.

# Keeping this bit down here for my own reference later...

## Deploy on Vercel

The easiest way to deploy your Next.js app is to use the [Vercel Platform](https://vercel.com/new?utm_medium=default-template&filter=next.js&utm_source=create-next-app&utm_campaign=create-next-app-readme) from the creators of Next.js.

Check out our [Next.js deployment documentation](https://nextjs.org/docs/deployment) for more details.
